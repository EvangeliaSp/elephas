                <div className="words"><p>I only use materials friendly for the skin. Mostly working with silver and
                    little pieces of art I find in nature such as pieces of wood and stones. I believe that the meaning
                    of jewelry is to express ourselves and not to show a status of money. That is why I try to work with
                    what our nature has to offer rather than use expensive materials.

                    support other peopleâ€™s dreams! Thank you for visiting my little heaven! Special credits to my friends
